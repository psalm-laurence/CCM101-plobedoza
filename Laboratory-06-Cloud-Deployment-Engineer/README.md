# Laboratory 06 - The Cloud Deployment Engineer

## Mission Overview

#### Congratulations!
Your flawless work in deploying data storage solutions has earned you a spot on the Cloud Deployment Team at CloudNova Technologies. Up until now, you have been deploying single containers (like a standalone web server or a storage bucket). However, real world enterprise applications are rarely just one container. They are "multi-tier" systems that require a frontend web application communicating seamlessly with a backend database. Deploying these one by one manually is prone to error. Enter Docker Compose. In this mission, you will transition from manual commands to Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Using a YAML configuration file, you will define a multi-container private cloud storage application (Nextcloud and MariaDB) and deploy the entire stack simultaneously with a single command! 

#### Remember: 
A junior engineer deploys servers by typing commands; a senior engineer deploys infrastructure by writing code.

## Objectives

* Explain the concept of a multi-tier application architecture. 
* Understand the purpose and structure of a docker-compose.yml file. 
* Use a Linux command-line text editor (nano) to create configuration files. 
* Deploy a multi-container application (Nextcloud + Database) using Docker Compose. 
* Document deployment procedures and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Markdown. 
* Continue expanding your professional GitHub Cloud Computing Portfolio. 

## Commands Executed

```bash
mkdir nextcloud-deployment
cd nextcloud-deployment
nano docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose down
```

## Skills Learned

Through this activity, I learned how to create a Docker Compose configuration and use it to deploy multiple containers at the same time. I also learned how Nextcloud can communicate with a MariaDB database using Docker Compose networking and environment variables. This activity improved my understanding of multi-tier applications, Infrastructure as Code, YAML configuration, and Docker Compose.
